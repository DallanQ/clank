[do-you-get-mastery-bonus-if-you-teleport-out](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032532/do-you-get-mastery-bonus-if-you-teleport-out)

> Can you get the 20 point mastery bonus if you teleport from the bottom of the dungeon to the inn? Or do you have to walk out the old-fashioned way to get the badge?

Teleportation is a special form of movement that allows you to move to any room connected to your current room. 
You can only exit the dungeon from the first room by the entrance. You are not allowed to teleport from the bottom of the dungeon.

[dragons-eye-mastery-token](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1667876/dragons-eye-mastery-token)

> The card Dragon's Eye says its worth 10 if you have a mastery token, what's a mastery token?

The 20 point token for returning to town.

[countdown-track-drawing-extra-cubes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1712890/countdown-track-drawing-extra-cubes)

> When a dragon attack is triggered by revealing a card and a meeple is currently on space 2, 3, or 4 of the countdown track (though it's not that player's turn), are extra cubes drawn from the bag, treating them like the extra cube on "Danger" cards? Right now, we are only drawing the extra cubes during the player's turn who is on the Countdown Track.

You're playing correctly. Those icons do not affect normal dragon attacks triggered by dungeon cards.

> When the dragon attack is initiated on the countdown track do you add any clank cubes on the board to the bag prior to drawing?

Yes, the pending clank cubes are always put in the bag before resolving a dragon attack.

[play-area](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2360825/play-area)

> What is the so called “play area” exactly?

The play area is wherever you place cards from your hand into play (usually right in front of you). Cards in play are contributing to your pool of resources (skill, boots, swords), while of course cards in your hand and discard are not. 

[market-refresh](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3342721/market-refresh)

> After you buy a card is the market immediately refreshed? 

No, the Dungeon Row is only refreshed at the end of a player’s turn, not immediately after buying a card.

> when going into a room with multiple minor secrets are you able to look and choose which one you want? Or do you take one at random?

For the minor secrets, you don’t get to look and choose which one you want if there are multiple; you simply draw one at random.

> If I move in a tunnel with monster icon and have no sword I take 1 damage. But what about if at the end of the movement I found a potion with a sword: can I use this sword to prevent the previous damage suffered?

No, you encountered the monster first, failed to kill it, suffered the 1 damage then moved on to discover the item.

[does-monkey-bot-trigger-an-attack-when-it-was-play](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2486662/does-monkey-bot-trigger-an-attack-when-it-was-play)

> Does monkey bot trigger an attack when it was played from my hand in my turn?

Attacks only happen when revealed in the dungeon row (or unless stated explicitly like for Mister Whiskers).

[resources-on-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1758632/resources-on-cards)

> Can I use all the resources on a card or choose only 1? E.g. if a card has both boots and swords can use that card on my turn both for moving and fighting?

You can use all the resources listed on the top left portion of the card. No need to pick and choose. You can use all of them!

[master-burglar](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1695944/master-burglar)

> When a Burglar is played, then trashed due to Master Burglar, does the skill point on the Burglar still count for the turn? We played as yes, since the rulebook states that resources count as soon as you play the card, but just want to clarify.

Yes, you still receive the skill point from the Burglar card, even if it is later trashed by Master Burglar. The resources are available as soon as you play the card, per the rulebook.

[endgame-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3343975/endgame-question)

> If a player has no artifact but is on the upper side of the dungeon, does this player score any points? The rule section about players being out of the competition mentions being knocked out after losing all 10 points of life. But if the player isn’t knocked out and it's endgame, does the same 'no score' condition apply?

To score points, a player must possess at least one artifact and be above ground. Without an artifact, a player cannot fully escape the dungeon, even if they're above the depths. Rules clarify that players knocked out above ground can be rescued only if they hold an artifact; otherwise, they don’t score.

[can-i-pick-up-a-tresure-by-taking-a-turn-later-aft](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3223110/can-i-pick-up-a-tresure-by-taking-a-turn-later-aft)

> After finishing a turn on a square containing a treasure, I decide not to pick it up. However, at the next turn's start, I regret my decision and want to collect it. Do I need to leave that square and re-enter to pick it up, or can I start the turn by taking it and then move to another square?

You would need to re-enter the square to pick up the treasure. However, it’s worth noting that the rules were updated, and you can now choose to pick up an artifact later, rather than only when you first enter the room.

[errata-needed-for-climbing-gear-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1770945/errata-needed-for-climbing-gear-card)

> Regarding the Climbing Gear card, which states, "You may discard a card to gain a +Boot," does this mean I can discard multiple cards for multiple movement points, or is it limited to one card for one movement point?

"A card" is just one card in all cases like this. The Climbing Gear card allows you to discard one card to gain a + Boot. Each card's text is used only once per turn unless another card allows reuse of a card.

[dwarven-peddler-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1759767/dwarven-peddler-clarification)

> The card reads, "Worth 4 victory points if you have two of the following: chalice, dragon egg, and monkey idol." Are you required to have two distinct items? For example, can you claim the points if you have two dragon eggs but no monkey idol or chalice?

You do not qualify for the points with two of the same item. You need two distinct items from the list to earn the 4 victory points.

[game-over-companion-app](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1903223/game-over-companion-app)

> When playing solo with the Companion App, should I press the Game Over button as soon as I exit the dungeon, or after progressing along the Countdown Track to the fifth space?

In solo play, the game ends as soon as you leave the dungeon, so you should press the Game Over button at that point. The Countdown Track is not used since there are no other players remaining in the dungeon.

[dragon-attack-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1823174/dragon-attack-rules)

> If you purchase a dragon card from the river and then play it, does that initiate another dragon attack?

No, a dragon attack only occurs when a dragon card enters the river, not when it is purchased or played. 

[minor-secrets](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1902128/minor-secrets)

> I own the German version of the game and have read about 2 minor secrets being placed in one room, but I don’t see this indicated on the board or in the rules. Should there be 2 minor secrets in each room at the start?

Yes, 2 minor secrets should be placed in each room at the start. In the German version, an error in the rules incorrectly states only 1 secret per room. The publisher corrected this by including a sticker with the updated rule in all copies. 

[being-knocked-out-during-turn](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2746701/being-knocked-out-during-turn)

> If I am knocked out during my turn (for example, by playing Mister Whiskers), does my turn end immediately?

Yes, your turn ends immediately if you are knocked out. However, you can choose the order in which to play your cards, so any actions that could knock you out can be delayed until the end of your turn if preferred.

[search-and-secrets-that-count-as-gold](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1793926/search-and-secrets-that-count-as-gold)

> If I collect a "2 gold" or "5 gold" secret during a turn in which I've played Search ("Each time you gain gold this turn, gain 1 extra gold"), do I gain 1 extra gold from Search, or does collecting the treasure not count as actually gaining gold since I didn't physically take any coins?

 Collecting a "2 gold" or "5 gold" secret does not count as gaining gold for the purpose of Search. The rules specify that "gaining gold" involves taking it from the Bank, which differs from finding gold through secrets. Therefore, Search does not provide extra gold for found treasures.

[intentional-death-allowed](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2693318/intentional-death-allowed)

> Is intentional death allowed?

No, intentional death is not allowed. According to the rules on page 8, under Step 4: The Getaway, players cannot intentionally take damage to facilitate their escape from the dungeon.

[question-regarding-the-app-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2252657/question-regarding-the-app-rules)

> When using the Renegade app in multiplayer, does a mini-boss animation indicate an immediate damage cube, or does the player need to add Clank?

In multiplayer, follow the text prompt from the app. The mini-boss animation itself does not indicate a damage cube or Clank. Instead, any required action will be specified by the app text upon pressing the button.

[empty-clank-bag](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1786164/empty-clank-bag)

> What happens if the dragon attacks and there are no cubes in the bag?

If the dragon attacks and there are no cubes left in the bag, no cubes are drawn, and the attack has no effect.

[market-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2225522/market-clarification)

> Are you allowed to stay in a market and buy? Are you only limited to one item each time?

You can buy as many items as you can afford when you're on the market space. Each purchase is a separate action, allowing you to buy multiple items in a single turn.

[purchasing-a-device-card-in-clank](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1738654/purchasing-a-device-card-in-clank)

> The rules mention that when you purchase a device card (purple banner), it does not become part of your deck and that you perform the USE text. The rules don't say that you have to perform the USE immediately. Can you save one or more device cards and use them when needed in the future, or do you have to perform the USE immediately after purchase? 

You must perform the USE text immediately after purchasing a device card. The rules specify that the card is removed from the game after use, similar to defeating a monster. There is no provision in the rules for setting it aside for later use.

[doubling-backmovement-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2367659/doubling-backmovement-question)

> Are you allowed to double back when moving in one turn? For example, can you move from space A to space B, then space C, back to space B, and finally return to space A? Additionally, is looping back around via the board layout allowed (e.g., moving from space A to space B to space C to space D and then back to space A)? 

Yes, you are allowed to double back when moving in one turn. The rules do not prohibit returning to previously visited spaces. You can even leave a minor secret space and re-enter it to gain another minor secret. However, it's generally more beneficial to focus on forward movement, as backtracking may hinder your progress.

[question-about-picking-card-with-companion](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1728233/question-about-picking-card-with-companion)

> When using the rule that allows you to draw a card by having a companion in play, is it one card drawn only if you have one companion in play, or is it one card drawn for each companion? The card text states: "If you have another companion in your play area, draw a card."

It is one card drawn, regardless of how many companions you have in play. You only draw one card when the condition is met.

> If you have three companions in your hand, does the drawing effect of the first companion trigger, allowing you to draw three cards? Or do you not count the first effect since you had no companions on the table before?

You only draw one card, no matter how many companions you have. The card effect states, "If you have another companion in your play area, draw a card," and this applies regardless of the order in which you play your cards.

[2-questions-on-tokens](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1739461/2-questions-on-tokens)

> When a player enters a room with two minor tokens, is it just a random choice of token?

Each time you enter a room with a token, you can pick one up. You can only take one token and cannot look at both if there are two. It doesn't matter whether you take the top or bottom token, as they were shuffled.

> If a player moves into two rooms during their turn, with tokens in each, will they get tokens from both rooms, or only in the room where they have ended movement?

When you enter a room with a secret token, you take it immediately. If you have enough movement, you could enter a room with two minor tokens, take one, leave the room, and then re-enter to take the second one in the same turn. You get a token from each room you visit upon your choice.

[was-this-end-game-correct](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1837506/was-this-end-game-correct)

> If a player is knocked out in the depths due to a dragon attack after a new market card with a dragon symbol is drawn, does that player automatically lose, even if they reach the first space of the castle?

Yes, the rules specify that if a player is knocked out in the depths, they automatically lose, as they cannot be rescued. If a player is knocked out above the depths, villagers can rescue them, allowing them to keep their collected items but without the 20-point bonus for exiting the dungeon on their own. Since you were knocked out in the depths, you lose automatically, even if you later reach the castle space.

[drawing-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1869469/drawing-cards)

> If I draw my entire deck during a turn and need to draw additional cards, what is the correct solution? For example, I encountered an infinite loop where I could endlessly cycle through my deck and gain infinite resources by repeatedly drawing and reshuffling.

You should place all played cards in front of you rather than directly into your discard pile. At the end of your turn, place everything you've played or bought into your discard pile. This prevents an infinite loop, as you cannot draw more cards once you've played through your entire deck. This solution ensures that you can only cycle through your deck once per turn, ending your turn once you’ve drawn and played all available cards.

[coin-purse-discard](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1772141/coin-purse-discard) 

> The Coin Purse card says it gives 2 coins when played, but provides 5 coins if discarded. Does "discard" here mean removing it permanently (trashing), or just placing it in the discard pile? And if it does mean "trash," don’t you need a Magic Spring token to do that? 

"Discard" on the Coin Purse card does not mean to trash it permanently; it simply requires placing it in the discard pile, not removing it from play. This effect activates only if another card allows you to discard it (such as "Sleight of Hand"), not when you naturally discard at the end of your turn. 

[treasure-hunter-card-ignore-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3031514/treasure-hunter-card-ignore-clarification) 

>  What does “ignore dragon symbol” mean on the Treasure Hunter card? 

It means that if you replace a card in the dungeon row and the new card has a dragon attack symbol, you simply ignore the symbol, so the dragon does not attack. You still place the card in the dungeon row; only the attack symbol is ignored.

[questions-about-the-end-of-the-line-or-countdown-t](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2288512/questions-about-the-end-of-the-line-or-countdown-t) 

> When a player advances one space on the Countdown Track, do the cubes in the Clank! area get added to the bag before drawing? Is it treated as a regular dragon attack with just a different number of cubes drawn?

Yes, you add the cubes from the Clank! area to the bag before drawing. It is treated as a regular dragon attack with the number of cubes specified by the Countdown Track. 

> On the second space of the Countdown Track, do you pull only 1 cube, or do you add it to the dragon’s current attack level, pulling 5+1=6 cubes if the dragon's marker is at 5? 

For the second space on the Countdown Track, you draw the usual number of cubes per the dragon’s current position plus 1, so it would be 5+1=6 if the dragon's marker is on 5. 

[randomized-artifacts](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1762011/randomized-artifacts)

> Has anyone tried randomizing the placement of artifacts? It seems like it could add more randomness to the game. Should an additional objective be added to balance out a high-value treasure being placed near the top? 

Randomizing artifact placement could add more variety, but it may lead to imbalances, especially if high-value artifacts end up closer to the starting area. This could make the game more luck-driven, as reaching high-value artifacts early might give an advantage unrelated to strategy or deck strength.

[teleport-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3079159/teleport-question)

> Can the card with the ability "teleport to an adjacent room" allow me to pass through rooms with a lock icon, and can I move in the opposite direction of an arrowed tunnel? 

Yes, teleporting lets you bypass all tunnel obstacles, including locked icons and directional arrows. However, you still need a connecting hallway between rooms, and you may be stuck if your only exit requires teleporting again.

[confused-about-minor-secrets](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2873206/confused-about-minor-secrets) 

> Adventuring party expansion rules suggests you keep the minor secrets in a bank at the side of the board. How does this change the game? Does this mean that if you enter multiple minor secret spots you simply take multiple secrets from the bank?

Only one minor secret per room per turn (no flip-flopping back and forth a bunch to get a stack of minor secrets), but no limit to the number of minor secrets available over the course of the game. Spent minor secrets are returned to the bank. This is how it is in Clank! Legacy too, and I much prefer it.

> I assume if you enter the same location a second time in the same turn then you wouldn't take a second secret, right? 

It is possible (though uncommon) to run out of minor secrets during the game; in these cases, you get nothing when entering a minor secret space. 

> Does this mean there is no limit to how many times you can take a secret from a room? Usually, once the secrets in a room are gone, that room generates no more secrets, but how does this work now?

Rooms cannot run out of secrets until the bank runs out of secrets.

[countdown-track](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1705218/countdown-track) 

> Can multiple player pawns be on the countdown track, or is it only for the first player to leave the dungeon? 

Only the first player to exit the dungeon (or be knocked out) uses the countdown track. According to the rulebook, once the first player is out, they place their pawn on the track, and it acts as a timer for the remaining rounds.

[taking-damage-in-a-tunnel-with-monster](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2572746/taking-damage-in-a-tunnel-with-monster)

> Can you avoid taking damage from a monster tunnel if you acquire swords later in your turn? Additionally, if your damage track fills and you still have health potions, can you use them to avoid being knocked out? 

No, you cannot retroactively use swords gained after moving through a monster tunnel. Damage from a monster tunnel is applied immediately as you cross, and any swords must be available at that time to prevent it. If you acquire swords later in the turn, they cannot be applied to avoid earlier damage. Similarly, if your damage track fills, you are immediately knocked out and cannot retroactively use a health potion to avoid it.
