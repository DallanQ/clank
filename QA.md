[dragons-eye-mastery-token](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1667876/dragons-eye-mastery-token)

> The card Dragon's Eye says its worth 10 if you have a mastery token, what's a mastery token?

A mastery token is a 20-point bonus given to players who escape the dungeon with an artifact. If you hold a mastery token when the game ends, the Dragon's Eye card grants you an additional 10 points, adding to your final score.

----
page 4

If you make it all the way back before being knocked out, you will receive a Mastery token worth an additional 20 points!

[play-area](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2360825/play-area)

> What is the so called “play area” exactly?

The play area is wherever you place cards from your hand into play (usually right in front of you). Cards in play are contributing to your pool of resources (skill, boots, swords), while of course cards in your hand and discard are not. 

----
page 10

When you play cards during your turn, they go to a play area in front of you. This helps keep track of the cards you've used this turn. 

----
page 7

Once you've played all of your cards and used as much of your resources as you want to, your turn ends. Put all of the cards you played into your discard pile and draw five new cards in preparation for your next turn.

[market-refresh](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3342721/market-refresh)

> After you buy a card is the market immediately refreshed? 

No, the Dungeon Row is only refreshed at the end of a player’s turn, not immediately after buying a card. 

----
page 8

At the end of every turn, if any of the six spaces for cards in the Dungeon Row are empty, refill them with new cards from the Dungeon Deck. If any of the cards drawn have a Dragon Attack symbol, the dragon attacks! (But only once, no matter how many Dragon Attack symbols were revealed.) 


> when going into a room with multiple minor secrets are you able to look and choose which one you want? Or do you take one at random? 

For the minor secrets, you don’t get to look and choose which one you want if there are multiple; you simply draw one at random. 

----
page 6

When you move into a room, you can take one of the tokens there (Minor Secret, Major Secret, Monkey Idol, or Artifact) and put it in front of you. 

----
page 6

You can only take one token when you move into a room. (If the room has more than one token in it, you must exit and re-enter to pick up another.)

> Can I use all the resources on a card or choose only 1? E.g. if a card has both boots and swords can use that card on my turn both for moving and fighting?

You can use all the resources listed on the top left portion of the card. No need to pick and choose. You can use all of them! 

----
page 6

During your turn, you can use the resources you've generated—Skill, Swords, and Boots—to take any of the following actions. You may take each action as many times as you like, as long as you have the resources to do so. You can wait and take your actions after you've played all of your cards, or you can take actions between cards if you wish.

[master-burglar](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1695944/master-burglar)

> When a Burglar is played, then trashed due to Master Burglar, does the skill point on the Burglar still count for the turn? 

Yes, you still receive the skill point from the Burglar card, even if it is later trashed by Master Burglar. The resources are available as soon as you play the card, per the rulebook. 

----
page 7

Once you've played all of your cards and used as much of your resources as you want to, your turn ends. 

----
page 10

Some cards and effects can cause you to trash a card. This removes the chosen card from your deck entirely. 

[endgame-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3343975/endgame-question)

> If a player is on the top side of the dungeon without an artifact, do they score any points?

To score points, a player must possess at least one artifact and be above ground. Without an artifact, a player cannot fully escape the dungeon, even if they're above the depths. Rules clarify that players knocked out above ground can be rescued only if they hold an artifact; otherwise, they don’t score. 

----
page 8

If you haven't gotten an Artifact yet, or if you are still stuck in the Depths, then you can't be rescued. You lose the competition, which at this point is the least of your worries. 

----
page 9

All players who escaped the dungeon (or at least the Depths) add up their score, counting the following:

(Icon of no.7 with a blue background) The Value Of Their Artifact.

(Icon of a Monkey Idol) Points from any other tokens they acquired.

(Icon of no.2 in cream background) Points equal to the amount of Gold they accumulated.

(Icon of no.3 in a green background) Points awarded by cards in their deck. (The top right corner of each card shows the amount it's worth.)

[errata-needed-for-climbing-gear-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1770945/errata-needed-for-climbing-gear-card)

> Regarding the Climbing Gear card, which states, "You may discard a card to gain a +Boot," does this mean I can discard multiple cards for multiple movement points, or is it limited to one card for one movement point?

"A card" is just one card in all cases like this. The Climbing Gear card allows you to discard one card to gain a + Boot. Each card's text is used only once per turn unless another card allows reuse of a card. 

----
page 10

Some cards ask you to discard a card. You can only discard cards in your hand that you haven't played yet. The card does not have its normal effect, which means discarding can be a useful way to get around cards that generate Clank! If you're asked to discard a card to get something, you must actually discard a card to get it.

---- 
page 6 

During your turn, you can use the resources you've generated—Skill, Swords, and Boots—to take any of the following actions. You may take each action as many times as you like, as long as you have the resources to do so.

[dragon-attack-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1823174/dragon-attack-rules)

> If you purchase a dragon card from the river and then play it, does that initiate another dragon attack?

No, a dragon attack only occurs when a dragon card enters the river, not when it is purchased or played.  

----
page 8

At the end of every turn, if any of the six spaces for cards in the Dungeon Row are empty, refill them with new cards from the Dungeon Deck. If any of the cards drawn have a Dragon Attack symbol, the dragon attacks! (But only once, no matter how many Dragon Attack symbols were revealed.) 

----
page 6

Once you pay the cost, place the card in your discard pile; it is now part of your deck.

[minor-secrets](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1902128/minor-secrets)

> I own the German version of the game and have read about 2 minor secrets being placed in one room, but I don’t see this indicated on the board or in the rules. Should there be 2 minor secrets in each room at the start?

Yes, 2 minor secrets should be placed in each room at the start. In the German version, an error in the rules incorrectly states only 1 secret per room. The publisher corrected this by including a sticker with the updated rule in all copies.  

----
page 2

Shuffle the Minor Secrets face down, then place one at random on each Minor Secret space. (Two in each room with Minor Secrets.)

[being-knocked-out-during-turn](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2746701/being-knocked-out-during-turn)

> If I am knocked out during my turn (for example, by playing Mister Whiskers), does my turn end immediately?

Yes, your turn ends immediately if you are knocked out. However, you can choose the order in which to play your cards, so any actions that could knock you out can be delayed until the end of your turn if preferred.

[search-and-secrets-that-count-as-gold](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1793926/search-and-secrets-that-count-as-gold)

> If I collect a "2 gold" or "5 gold" secret during a turn in which I've played Search ("Each time you gain gold this turn, gain 1 extra gold"), do I gain 1 extra gold from Search, or does collecting the treasure not count as actually gaining gold since I didn't physically take any coins?

 Collecting a "2 gold" or "5 gold" secret does not count as gaining gold for the purpose of Search. The rules specify that "gaining gold" involves taking it from the Bank, which differs from finding gold through secrets. Therefore, Search does not provide extra gold for found treasures.

[intentional-death-allowed](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2693318/intentional-death-allowed)

> Is intentional death allowed?

No, intentional death is not allowed. According to the rules on page 8, under Step 4: The Getaway, players cannot intentionally take damage to facilitate their escape from the dungeon.

[question-regarding-the-app-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2252657/question-regarding-the-app-rules)

> When using the Renegade app in multiplayer, does a mini-boss animation indicate an immediate damage cube, or does the player need to add Clank?

In multiplayer, follow the text prompt from the app. The mini-boss animation itself does not indicate a damage cube or Clank. Instead, any required action will be specified by the app text upon pressing the button.

[empty-clank-bag](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1786164/empty-clank-bag)

> What happens if the dragon attacks and there are no cubes in the bag?

If the dragon attacks and there are no cubes left in the bag, no cubes are drawn, and the attack has no effect.

[market-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2225522/market-clarification)

> Are you allowed to stay in a market and buy? Are you only limited to one item each time?

You can buy as many items as you can afford when you're on the market space. Each purchase is a separate action, allowing you to buy multiple items in a single turn.

[purchasing-a-device-card-in-clank](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1738654/purchasing-a-device-card-in-clank)

> When you buy a device card (purple banner), must you perform the USE effect immediately, or can you save it to use later? 

You must perform the USE text immediately after purchasing a device card. The rules specify that the card is removed from the game after use, similar to defeating a monster. There is no provision in the rules for setting it aside for later use.

[doubling-backmovement-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2367659/doubling-backmovement-question)

> Are you allowed to double back when moving in one turn? For example, can you move from space A to space B, then space C, back to space B, and finally return to space A? Additionally, is looping back around via the board layout allowed (e.g., moving from space A to space B to space C to space D and then back to space A)? 

Yes, you are allowed to double back when moving in one turn. The rules do not prohibit returning to previously visited spaces. You can even leave a minor secret space and re-enter it to gain another minor secret. However, it's generally more beneficial to focus on forward movement, as backtracking may hinder your progress.

[question-about-picking-card-with-companion](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1728233/question-about-picking-card-with-companion)

> When using the rule that allows you to draw a card by having a companion in play, is it just one card drawn only if you have one companion in play, or do you draw one card for each companion?

It is one card drawn, regardless of how many companions you have in play. You only draw one card when the condition is met.


[2-questions-on-tokens](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1739461/2-questions-on-tokens)

> When a player enters a room with two minor tokens, is it just a random choice of token?

Each time you enter a room with a token, you can pick one up. You can only take one token and cannot look at both if there are two. It doesn't matter whether you take the top or bottom token, as they were shuffled.

> If a player moves into two rooms during their turn, with tokens in each, will they get tokens from both rooms, or only in the room where they have ended movement?

When you enter a room with a secret token, you take it immediately. If you have enough movement, you could enter a room with two minor tokens, take one, leave the room, and then re-enter to take the second one in the same turn. You get a token from each room you visit upon your choice.

> If a player is knocked out in the depths due to a dragon attack after a new market card with a dragon symbol is drawn, does that player automatically lose, even if they reach the first space of the castle?

Yes, if a player is knocked out in the depths, they automatically lose, as they cannot be rescued. If knocked out above the depths, villagers can rescue them, allowing them to keep collected items but without the 20-point bonus for escaping on their own.

[drawing-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1869469/drawing-cards)

> If I draw my entire deck during a turn and need to draw additional cards, what is the correct solution? For example, I encountered an infinite loop where I could endlessly cycle through my deck and gain infinite resources by repeatedly drawing and reshuffling.

You should place all played cards in front of you rather than directly into your discard pile. At the end of your turn, place everything you've played or bought into your discard pile. This prevents an infinite loop, as you cannot draw more cards once you've played through your entire deck. This solution ensures that you can only cycle through your deck once per turn, ending your turn once you’ve drawn and played all available cards.

[coin-purse-discard](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1772141/coin-purse-discard) 

> The Coin Purse card says it gives 2 coins when played, but provides 5 coins if discarded. Does "discard" here mean removing it permanently (trashing), or just placing it in the discard pile? And if it does mean "trash," don’t you need a Magic Spring token to do that? 

"Discard" on the Coin Purse card does not mean to trash it permanently; it simply requires placing it in the discard pile, not removing it from play. This effect activates only if another card allows you to discard it (such as "Sleight of Hand"), not when you naturally discard at the end of your turn. 

[treasure-hunter-card-ignore-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3031514/treasure-hunter-card-ignore-clarification) 

>  What does “ignore dragon symbol” mean on the Treasure Hunter card? 

It means that if you replace a card in the dungeon row and the new card has a dragon attack symbol, you simply ignore the symbol, so the dragon does not attack. You still place the card in the dungeon row; only the attack symbol is ignored.

[questions-about-the-end-of-the-line-or-countdown-t](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2288512/questions-about-the-end-of-the-line-or-countdown-t) 

> When a player advances one space on the Countdown Track, do the cubes in the Clank! area get added to the bag before drawing?

Yes, you add the cubes from the Clank! area to the bag before drawing. It is treated as a regular dragon attack with the number of cubes specified by the Countdown Track.

> On the second space of the Countdown Track, do you pull only 1 cube, or do you add it to the dragon’s current attack level, pulling 5+1=6 cubes if the dragon's marker is at 5?

For the second space on the Countdown Track, you draw the usual number of cubes per the dragon’s current position plus 1, so it would be 5+1=6 if the dragon's marker is on 5.

> Can the card with the ability "teleport to an adjacent room" allow me to pass through rooms with a lock icon, and can I move in the opposite direction of an arrowed tunnel? 

Yes, teleporting lets you bypass all tunnel obstacles, including locked icons and directional arrows. However, you still need a connecting hallway between rooms, and you may be stuck if your only exit requires teleporting again.

[confused-about-minor-secrets](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2873206/confused-about-minor-secrets) 

> I assume if you enter the same location a second time in the same turn then you wouldn't take a second secret, right? 

It is possible (though uncommon) to run out of minor secrets during the game; in these cases, you get nothing when entering a minor secret space. 

> Does this mean there is no limit to how many times you can take a secret from a room? Usually, once the secrets in a room are gone, that room generates no more secrets, but how does this work now?

Rooms cannot run out of secrets until the bank runs out of secrets.

[countdown-track](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1705218/countdown-track) 

> Can multiple player pawns be on the countdown track, or is it only for the first player to leave the dungeon? 

Only the first player to exit the dungeon (or be knocked out) uses the countdown track. According to the rulebook, once the first player is out, they place their pawn on the track, and it acts as a timer for the remaining rounds.

[taking-damage-in-a-tunnel-with-monster](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2572746/taking-damage-in-a-tunnel-with-monster)

> Can you avoid taking damage from a monster tunnel if you acquire swords later in your turn? Additionally, if your damage track fills and you still have health potions, can you use them to avoid being knocked out? 

No, you cannot retroactively use swords gained after moving through a monster tunnel. Damage from a monster tunnel is applied immediately as you cross, and any swords must be available at that time to prevent it. If you acquire swords later in the turn, they cannot be applied to avoid earlier damage. Similarly, if your damage track fills, you are immediately knocked out and cannot retroactively use a health potion to avoid it. 

[questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1655035/questions)

> Do I have to play all the cards in my hand each turn, including "Stumble"? And can I pick up or buy more Monkey Idols, Crowns, or Backpacks?

Yes, you must play all the cards in your hand each turn, including "Stumble." The only way to avoid playing a card like "Stumble" is by using other cards that allow you to discard, such as Sleight of Hand or Apothecary.

[using-a-device](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1654735/using-a-device) 

> Do you need to use a device immediately when you acquire it, or can you hold onto it for later use?

Devices must be used immediately when acquired and cannot be held for later use. According to the rules, devices are used at the moment they are acquired and are then placed in the Dungeon discard pile, not added to your deck.

[question-on-adjacency](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1753590/question-on-adjacency) 

> Can I use the Wand of Wind to take a secret from a room connected by a one-way tunnel that I cannot normally travel down? Does "adjacent" include one-way tunnels in the opposite direction? 

Yes, you can use the Wand of Wind to take a secret from an adjacent room, even if it’s connected by a one-way tunnel in the opposite direction. "Adjacent" in this context refers to any room connected by a path, regardless of direction, locks, or monsters.

[where-to-leave-the-dungeon-and-what-are-the-hands](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1771766/where-to-leave-the-dungeon-and-what-are-the-hands)

> How do you leave the dungeon? Is it by going to the entrance? Also, what do the hands on the board signify? There are two hands showing outside the dungeon along the ways. Are they indicating the exit? 

You exit the dungeon the same way you enter, at the entrance in the top left corner of the board. The hands indicate that the board "wraps around" at that point, allowing you to move from one side to the other as a shortcut, rather than traveling all the way across the board.

> Does collecting a Secret count as "gaining" gold for the purposes of the "Search" card, which allows you to gain an extra gold each time you gain any gold?

Yes, collecting a Secret counts as "gaining" gold, as you end up with more gold than you had before.

>  If you have Mr. Whiskers and no Clank to remove, can you still perform the remove action if you don't want to attack with the dragon?

Yes, you can choose the -2 Clank option even if you have no Clank in the pool.

> Can you buy more than two of the same items? If so, does buying both backpacks mean you can carry three artifacts?

Yes, you can buy more than two of the same item, so having two backpacks allows you to carry three artifacts, each being unique since none of the artifacts are duplicated.

[hand-icon-on-tunnel](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1908063/hand-icon-on-tunnel)

> What does the hand icon mean on the tunnel? There are two tunnels with the hand icon on the edge of the board.

The hand icon indicates that the tunnels are connected. You can move from one side of the board to the other using that tunnel. According to the rulebook, "Wrap-around” Tunnels — Tunnels that go off the edge of the game board connect to the opposite side of the board. They only require one Boot, like other normal tunnels (see page 10, Advanced Maneuvers).

[running-out-of-clank](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1705314/running-out-of-clank) 

> Can I still play a card that generates Clank if I am out of Clank cubes? 

Yes, if you are out of Clank cubes, you can still play cards that generate Clank. According to the rules, if you have no Clank cubes left, you’re not required to add any more Clank to the Clank area. However, once you regain cubes through healing or other effects, you’ll need to add Clank as usual. 

[teleporting-back-into-the-dungeon](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2746702/teleporting-back-into-the-dungeon) 

> If I leave the dungeon and, later in the same turn, play a card that instructs me to teleport to a connected room, am I required to teleport back into the dungeon? 

No, once you have left the dungeon, you are not allowed to reenter. Although teleport effects are generally mandatory, exiting the dungeon is intended to be final, with no reentry allowed. Any cards played after exiting that would require you to reenter can be ignored.

[aquire-cards-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1658887/aquire-cards-clarification) 

> Do the symbols on Acquire cards indicate negative effects? For example, does a heart symbol mean you take or remove damage, and does a +2 Clank symbol mean you add Clank? Do you need certain resources, like swords, to purchase these cards? 

Acquire effects can be either positive or negative, depending on the card. For example, a heart symbol generally indicates healing, so you remove one damage when acquiring the card; you don’t need to be damaged beforehand. The +2 Clank symbol means you add two Clank to the Clank area when you acquire the card. You do not need specific resources, like swords, to purchase cards with these symbols. 

[confused-about-dragon-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1839314/confused-about-dragon-card) 

> When a dragon card is drawn into the Dungeon Row, does it go to the discard pile after the dragon attack, or stay in the row? When and how is the bottom effect resolved?

When a dragon card is drawn, it triggers a dragon attack immediately but remains in the Dungeon Row until it is purchased or defeated. The bottom effect is resolved only when a player buys or defeats the card. If multiple dragon cards are drawn, only one attack is performed.

[minor-secret-tokens](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3178619/minor-secret-tokens) 

> How many of each type of "Minor Secret" token should there be according to the rulebook? 

The Clank! rulebook states that there are 18 Minor Secret tokens in total, divided among seven types: Potion of Healing, Potion of Swiftness, Potion of Strength, Skill Boost, Treasure, Magic Spring, and Dragon Egg. However, it does not provide a breakdown of quantities by type. 

[black-cubes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1657218/black-cubes) 

> When do cubes go back into the Dragon Bag? 

Clank cubes only go back into the Dragon Bag if a specific card effect instructs you to place them there. At the start of a dragon attack, all Clank cubes from the Clank Area are put into the bag, but after drawing, any player-colored cubes drawn as damage remain out of the bag unless a card effect later returns them.

[room-adjacency](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1691242/room-adjacency)  

[optional-effects](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1828742/optional-effects) 

> Are all card effects in Clank! mandatory, or are some optional, such as drawing, trashing, or discarding? 

All card effects in Clank! are mandatory unless specified otherwise. This includes drawing, trashing, and discarding effects, which must be resolved when the card is played. 

> Is teleporting mandatory, and if so, can you teleport back to the same room? 

Yes, teleporting is mandatory when a card instructs you to do so. However, you must teleport to an adjacent room; teleporting back to the same room is not allowed unless you reenter by other means.

[companion-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2651372/companion-clarification)  

> When a companion allows you to draw a card if you meet the requirements, which deck do you draw the card from?

You always draw from your own deck, not the market or the dungeon deck.

[purchase-in-market](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1759334/purchase-in-market)

> When you're in a market room, can you buy only one item, or as many as you can afford? For example, could you buy both backpacks in a single visit if you have enough gold?

You can buy as many items as you can afford when in a market room. There is no limit to the number of items you can purchase in a single turn as long as you have enough gold.

[dungeon-row-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1988405/dungeon-row-cards) 

> If no one buys any cards from the Dungeon Row for a few turns, are you supposed to remove a card and replace it? We couldn’t find a rule for this, so we decided to remove the lowest-cost card each turn that no one buys anything. 

The rules do not specify any requirement to remove cards from the Dungeon Row if they remain unpurchased. Cards that may initially seem less useful often find value later in the game as strategies evolve. The Dungeon Row remains unchanged until players buy cards, naturally shifting the row over time as purchases are made.

[tunnels-with-footprints](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2264555/tunnels-with-footprints)

> Can you move halfway down a tunnel with one Boot and then move the rest of the way on your next turn if you get another Boot?

No, movement in Clank! requires you to spend Boots in the same turn to complete each move fully. You cannot stop halfway through a tunnel, as tunnels are not considered rooms where players can pause. All Boots needed for movement between rooms must be used during the same turn.

[movement-and-buying](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2041510/movement-and-buying) 

> Can I move into a market space, buy something, and then continue moving? 

Yes, if you have enough Boot symbols, you can move into a market space, make a purchase, and continue moving. Movement and purchases are separate actions, so as long as you have sufficient Boots, you can keep moving after buying.

[dungeon-row-sequential-or-all-at-once](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2547875/dungeon-row-sequential-or-all-at-once) 

> When replacing empty Dungeon Row spaces at the end of a turn, are replacement cards considered to be placed all at once or sequentially? For example, if the first replacement triggers a dragon attack and the second says “return three black cubes to the bag,” which happens first? 

Replacement cards are resolved in the order they are revealed. Each card’s Arrive effect, if any, is carried out as soon as it appears in the Dungeon Row, before any dragon attack triggered by a new card. So, if the first card triggers a dragon attack and the second card has an Arrive effect to return black cubes, you would return the cubes to the bag before conducting the dragon attack.

[rules-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1732710/rules-questions)  

> Do discarded cards count toward the skill, movement, or swords I generate on my turn? 

No, discarded cards do not contribute to your skill, movement, or sword count. According to the rules, only cards you play directly provide these resources. Discards do not offer their effects when discarded. 

> Can I use a card’s discard power to discard itself? 

No, a card with a discard effect cannot be used to discard itself. Discard effects apply only to other cards in your hand that have not yet been played.

> Can I execute the action on a card and then discard the card to a discard effect?

No, if you use a card’s actions, you cannot then discard it for a discard effect. Discard effects can only be applied to cards that haven’t been played.

> What happens if the dragon bag runs out of Clank cubes when cubes would be drawn? 

If the dragon bag runs out of cubes, no more cubes are drawn for that attack. The attack has no effect if there are no cubes left in the bag.

[rule-clarifications](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1739086/rule-clarifications) 

>  If I play a -2 Clank card after a Stumble card that adds Clank, and then draw another Stumble, will the -2 Clank remove the new Clank as well?

Yes, the -2 Clank effect "floats" for the rest of your turn and will cancel out future Clank added during that turn. So, if you draw a new Stumble after playing the -2 Clank card, the -2 effect can still remove the new Clank.

> If a player with an artifact is knocked out on the surface, is the only downside that they miss the mastery token?

Yes, the player does not receive the 20-point mastery token. Additionally, they may have fewer turns as other players continue their turns.

> Besides starting Clank and cards that specifically add Clank, are there other ways to add Clank?

In the base game, Clank can only be added through starting Clank and cards that explicitly add or remove Clank. No other methods for adding Clank are provided without expansions or apps.

[major-and-minor-secret-tokens](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1771847/major-and-minor-secret-tokens) 

> Can we keep the Major and Minor Secret tokens (other than those that say "play immediately") face down until later use? The rulebook doesn’t seem to specify.

No, tokens must be revealed immediately when taken, as stated in the rulebook. However, after revealing them, there’s no restriction on placing non-immediate-use tokens face down until they’re used. 

[monkeybot-3000](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1808608/monkeybot-3000) 

> If a card states "+3 Clank! Draw 3 cards," does this mean I can choose to add 3 Clank to draw 3 cards, or must I add 3 Clank each time the card is drawn? 

You must add 3 Clank to the Clank area whenever you play this card. All effects listed on a card are mandatory when the card is played, not simply when it is drawn.

[trash-cards-and-discard-pile](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2727021/trash-cards-and-discard-pile) 

When a card instructs you to trash a card, can you choose a card from previous rounds in the discard pile, or only one played this turn in the play area? 

> You can choose to trash a card from either your discard pile from previous rounds or your play area from the current turn. Trashing removes the card from the game entirely by returning it to the box.

[2-rebel-scouts-and-can-you-buy-multiple-market-ite](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1816724/2-rebel-scouts-and-can-you-buy-multiple-market-ite) 

> If I play two Rebel Scout companions, each stating, "if another companion is in the play area, draw a card," do they both activate each other, allowing me to draw two cards? 

Yes, if both Rebel Scouts are in the play area, each one satisfies the other's condition, allowing you to draw a card for each. So, playing two Rebel Scouts would let you draw two cards.

> Can you buy multiple items at a market space if you have enough gold, or must you buy and exit the space to purchase another item? 

Yes, you can buy multiple items in a single turn while on a market space, as long as you have enough gold. There is no requirement to leave the space between purchases, so you may buy two or more items at once if you can afford them.

[ladder-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1683593/ladder-card)

> How does a Device card with two Boots work, and why doesn’t it just show Boots in the top left like other movement cards? 

Device cards, marked with a purple banner, are used immediately when acquired. For a Device with two Boots, you can move two spaces immediately upon acquiring it, after which the card is discarded and does not remain in your deck. This rule is found in the manual under "Use a Device" in Step 2: The Plan.

[tiebreakers](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1759039/tiebreakers) 

> How do tiebreakers work if multiple players are knocked out, specifically if both are in the depths and eliminated by the same dragon attack? What if one or more are above the depths?

If all players are knocked out in the depths, they cannot be rescued, and everyone loses. However, if players are knocked out above the depths and have artifacts, they are rescued, and their points count. In the case of a tie in points, the player with the most valuable artifact wins, as specified in the rulebook.

[do-you-use-the-effects-of-a-bought-card-instantly](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2901821/do-you-use-the-effects-of-a-bought-card-instantly) 

> Do you get the benefits of a card immediately upon purchasing it, or does it go to the discard pile to be used in a future turn? 

Generally, purchased cards go to your discard pile, so you don’t gain their benefits immediately. However, Monster cards and Device cards (purple banner) grant their effects right away and are then removed. Cards with an "Acquire" effect also apply that effect immediately upon purchase, though the card itself still goes to the discard pile.

[overlord-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1740932/overlord-question)

> If I draw two cards and one is a monster, do I shuffle it back, place it down, or handle it some other way? 

You only draw cards from your own deck, which does not include monsters. Monsters appear in the Dungeon Row and provide a one-time benefit when defeated. If you accidentally draw a monster from the Dungeon Row, it should not be added to your hand or deck.

[newbe-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2278353/newbe-questions)

> If I have 3 swords and I need 2 to fight an enemy and 1 for the goblin, can I fight both enemies?

Yes, symbols like swords go into a "pool" for your turn, allowing you to distribute them as needed. You can use 2 swords for one enemy and 1 for the goblin in the same turn.

> Can I use both the card text and the symbols in the upper left corner of a card during my turn?

Yes, when you play a card, you gain both its text effect and symbols, which go into your resource pool for the turn. You may choose the order of play for your cards, but all effects are applied once the card is played. 

> Can I skip a positive effect on a card, such as a card’s text or skill?

No, card effects are mandatory unless they explicitly say "may." You must apply all benefits or effects when you play the card, even if they don’t currently benefit you (like healing at full health). 

> Can I combine all my symbols (swords, skill, boots) freely at any point in my turn? 

Yes, you can use symbols from your pool in any order throughout your turn, allowing you to perform actions such as moving, fighting, and purchasing as you like within the turn.

[holding-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1997717/holding-cards) 

> Are players supposed to hold their next five cards in their hand, or should they draw them at the start of their turn? 

Players draw their next five cards at the end of their turn, so they are ready to start planning for the following turn. This allows turns to progress smoothly without waiting for players to draw at the start of each turn.

[dragon-attack-twice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1838990/dragon-attack-twice) 

> If a dragon symbol is revealed in the Dungeon Row while the Countdown Track also triggers a dragon attack, would the dragon attack twice or just once? 

The dragon would attack twice in this scenario. Each attack trigger (a dragon symbol in the Dungeon Row and advancing on the Countdown Track) results in a separate dragon attack. 

[2-backpacks](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3344014/2-backpacks) 

> Can a player have more than one backpack to carry three artifacts? 

Yes, owning multiple backpacks would allow a player to carry additional artifacts. Each backpack permits carrying one extra artifact, so with two backpacks, you could carry up to three artifacts if you have enough time and gold to acquire them.

[must-play-each-card-eventually](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2655972/must-play-each-card-eventually)

> Are you required to play every card in your hand each turn, including Stumble cards?

Yes, all cards in your hand must be played each turn, including Stumble cards, unless a card effect allows you to discard them. While you can choose the order of play, each card’s effect is mandatory, making Stumble cards unavoidable unless specifically discarded.

[can-pickpocket-ignore-rules-to-acquire-a-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2937589/can-pickpocket-ignore-rules-to-acquire-a-card)

> If I use Pickpocket with Fishing Pole to acquire Grand Plan, which costs 5 skill but says "gain 2 gold" when acquired, do I still need to pay 2 gold? 

No, you don’t need to pay 2 gold. The "acquire" effect is a bonus, so you gain 2 gold upon acquiring Grand Plan. Acquire effects provide benefits when you obtain the card and are not additional costs.

[question-about-dead-run-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1696532/question-about-dead-run-card) 

> If I don’t use the boots on a card, do I still get the +2 Clank penalty? 

Yes, you still receive the +2 Clank penalty. All effects on a card must be applied when it’s played, even if you don’t use every symbol, such as boots. The Clank is added as part of the card’s effect.

[renegade-and-other-conditional-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1798801/renegade-and-other-conditional-cards) 

> If I play two Renegade companions, each with “draw a card if you have another companion in the play area,” do both cards let me draw, or only if a companion was already present when each was played? 

Both Renegade companions will allow you to draw a card as long as both are in your play area by the end of the turn. The effect applies based on the "pool" concept, meaning you meet the draw condition for each card as long as there’s another companion in play by the end of the round.

[can-i-have-more-than-5-cards-in-my-play-area](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2041154/can-i-have-more-than-5-cards-in-my-play-area) 

> Can I have more than five cards in my play area if a card effect lets me draw extra? And when a card says to "draw a card," is that from my deck or the Dungeon Deck? 

Yes, you can have more than five cards in your play area if you draw extra cards on your turn. When a card says to "draw a card," it means from your personal deck, not the Dungeon Deck. The Dungeon Deck is only used to refill the Dungeon Row.

[gold-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1729908/gold-question)

> Is gold a finite resource in the game, and is there a maximum limit?

Gold is intended to be a plentiful resource, and there is no maximum limit stated in the rules. The game is designed to have more gold in the box than players can realistically obtain. If you run out of gold pieces during the game, it's advisable to proxy additional gold, as dragons should have more gold in their hoards than can fit in a board game box.

>  If I have Mister Whiskers and play him (to trigger a dragon attack) as I'm leaving the dungeon, am I still vulnerable to damage, or do I still receive the +20 point token for exiting, regardless of the dragon attack? 

You can play Mister Whiskers without concern, as you have already exited the dungeon before the dragon attack occurs. You will receive the +20 Mastery Token for exiting, as stated in the rules: "Once you’ve picked up an Artifact, you can also make your way back to the place you started, outside of the dungeon. If you make it all the way back before being knocked out, you will receive a Mastery token worth an additional 20 points!"

[starting-turn-in-a-market](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1750792/starting-turn-in-a-market) 

> If you start at a market, can you buy things from it before you start moving? The rules do not explicitly prohibit this, but most everything else triggers only when you enter. 

Yes, you can make market purchases at any point while you are in a Market space, whether you just entered or have been there for a while.

[health-track-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1845637/health-track-question)

> If you just bought a physical copy of Clank, do players start with one cube on the health track?

You do NOT start with any cubes on your health track. Cubes are only placed there when taking wounds from monster tunnels or when pulled from the Dragon Bag.

Cards bought from the dungeon row go immediately into the discard pile and cannot be used in the same turn.
